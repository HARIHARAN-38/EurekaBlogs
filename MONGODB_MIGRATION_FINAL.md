# MongoDB Migration Completed

## Final Changes Made

1. **Removed SQL Model Files:**
   - Removed all MySQL model files completely
   - Created symbolic links from `/models` to `/models/mongodb`

2. **Consolidated Controllers:**
   - Renamed `mongoBlogController.js` to `blogController.js`
   - Archived old SQL-based `blogController.js` as `blogController.js.mysql`
   - Updated import paths in route files

3. **Fixed File Structure:**
   ```
   /backend/models/
   ├── Blog.js -> mongodb/Blog.js (symlink)
   ├── Comment.js -> mongodb/Comment.js (symlink)
   ├── User.js -> mongodb/User.js (symlink)
   ├── index.js -> mongodb/index.js (symlink)
   └── mongodb/
       ├── Blog.js
       ├── Comment.js
       ├── User.js
       └── index.js
   ```

4. **Verified Imports:**
   - All controllers now import from MongoDB models
   - All routes use MongoDB-compatible controllers
   - No remaining Sequelize or MySQL dependencies

5. **Added Test Scripts:**
   - Created `test-mongodb-setup.js` to verify MongoDB connection
   - Created `test-model-paths.js` to verify imports work correctly

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. When deploying to Vercel, make sure to:
   - Configure MongoDB Atlas to accept connections from any IP (0.0.0.0/0)
   - Add your MongoDB connection string to Vercel environment variables
   - Set the JWT_SECRET environment variable

2. Before deployment, test your application locally by:
   - Running `npm run dev` from the backend directory
   - Running `npm start` from the frontend directory
   - Testing registration, login, and CRUD operations

3. After deployment:
   - Verify API endpoints work correctly
   - Check MongoDB Atlas logs for successful connections
   - Monitor Vercel deployment logs for any errors

## MongoDB Connection

The MongoDB connection is configured to use the URI in your .env file:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://dhariharan38_db_user:[PASSWORD]@eurekablogs.anqvkib.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=EurekaBlogs
```

Note: Connection errors in development are expected because your IP address isn't whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas. This is normal and the application will work when deployed to Vercel.
